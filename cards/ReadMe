Card.java:	added a value() method
		
Cards.java:	abstract class to make an ArrayList of Cards

Deck.java:	final subclass of Cards that makes a deck of cards,
		shuffles, cuts and deals them out.
Hand.java:	final subclass of Cards that holds a hand of cards
		and adds/deletes cards from it.
PlayCards.java:	main() makes a deck of cards, shuffles and cuts it,
		deals it out to four hands and displays the total value 
		and contents of each hand. 

The program seems to work, but I notice the shuffling method may not be 
very good, player4 seems to get the Ace of Spades quite often! 

There may be a simpler way to impliment cut() if I could work out how to
pull a block of cards from the ArrayList in one go instead of one at a 
time. Wish ArrayList.removeRange() could returned such a block.
Shuffling, cutting, dealing all seemed easier to impliment using ArrayList
mainly because I no longer needed to keep track of indexes and array sizes.
