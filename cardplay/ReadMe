This is not meant to be production code, it is just for playing with
various features of Java, as I learn how to use them.

Card.java: features enumerated types.
Deck.java: uses a private static array of cards
		cutting, shuffling, dealing, printing, seem to work
Hand.java: uses a private array of cards kept in sorted order
		adding, deleting, printing, seem to work
PlayCards.java: uses a new deck, shuffles, cuts and deals to four hands

NB: Despite deck being private static in Deck class, PlayCards can make 
    a deck of cards and access its methods, and despite the hand array 
    of cards in Hand class being private, PlayCards can still make an 
    array of hands and access their methods. Maybe this is ok.
    But PlayCards can see what card is dealt to each player. This is 
    not so good.
