A first attempt to use javax.swing - to display cards
Took a while to get it working as envisaged, not worth developing
further. I was getting JFrame and JPanel mixed up to begin with
but hopefully that's all sorted out now. No attempt has been made
to set any particular Look&Feel, or Layout Constraints. It just
relies on default settings.

PlayCards.java now just offers one method, dealCards(int players).
I doubt I will add any more, this program was more about getting
to grips with Swing.

Hand.java now has a method getHand() that returns a multi-line
String summarising the player's hand.

DisplayCards.java displays a window containing a JFrame that holds 
a JPanel containing four JTextAreas and a "Quit" JButton.
The JTextAreas display the output of getHand for each player.

There are so many ways this program could be improved, but I'm
need to move on to something simple but more interactive now.
